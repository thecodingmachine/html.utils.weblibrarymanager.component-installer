WebLibraryManager: Installer for the Rob Loach's "component" packages
====================================================================

If you have been looking around for JS/CSS packages on Packagist, it is likely you have stumbled on "component/*" packages.
These packages, designed by [Rob Loach](http://github.com/robloach/component-installer), provide a nice way to access
JS/CSS ressources. For instance, have a look at the **component/jquery** package on Packagist.

The **WebLibraryManager** has a built in support for these components. If you import one of those composer packages
in your project, the **WebLibraryManager** will detect these packages and will automatically create the **WebLibrary** instances
matching those packages.
